Every time I hear "we'll add accessibility later," I know what it means. It means never.

Accessibility isn't a feature you bolt on after the fact. It's a constraint that shapes how you build — and if you ignore it long enough, it costs ten times more to fix than it would have to do right the first time.

## The misconception

Most developers think accessibility means blind users and screen readers. That's part of it. But it's also:

- Someone using your app on a train with one hand
- Someone who gets migraines and needs reduced motion
- Someone on a slow connection in a country with bad infrastructure
- Someone using a keyboard because their mouse broke

Accessibility is performance. It's good UX. It's just building things that work.

## What actually helps

Semantic HTML does more work than most people give it credit for. A `<button>` is focusable, activatable by keyboard, and announced correctly by screen readers. A `<div onClick>` is none of those things without extra work.

Focus management matters a lot in SPAs. When a modal opens, focus should move into it. When it closes, focus should return to where it was. This is not hard to implement and it makes a significant difference.

Color contrast is non-negotiable. WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text) is the minimum. I aim for AAA where I can.

## The honest truth

I don't always get this right. But I've stopped treating it as an edge case and started treating it as a quality signal. If something is inaccessible, it's not done.
