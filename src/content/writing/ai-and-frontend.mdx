The question I keep hearing is: *where does the AI go?* Backend? A separate service? A different team's problem?

My take — the frontend is increasingly where AI becomes real for users. Not in the model weights, not in the APIs, but in the moment of interaction.

## The shift happening right now

We're moving from AI as a feature (a chatbot widget in the corner) to AI as infrastructure for the entire UI layer. Think about it:

- Autocomplete that actually understands context
- Forms that help you fill them out
- Interfaces that adapt to what you're trying to do

This is frontend work. And most frontend developers aren't prepared for it.

## Streaming responses

The biggest UX unlock is streaming. Instead of waiting for a full response, you render tokens as they arrive. Here's a minimal example using the Vercel AI SDK:

```tsx
import { useChat } from "ai/react";

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <p key={m.id}>{m.content}</p>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `useChat` hook handles streaming for you. The real work is making the UI feel good while it happens.

## What changes for the developer

The hardest part isn't calling an API. It's the UX decisions that come after.

How do you show streaming text without it feeling jarring? How do you handle latency without a spinner that kills the mood? How do you build trust in an output that might be wrong?

These are product and design problems first, engineering problems second.

## What I've learned so far

Keep the model out of the critical path where you can. Stream aggressively. Be honest about uncertainty in the UI. And don't use AI where deterministic logic works fine — it's a tool, not a personality.

More to come on this.
