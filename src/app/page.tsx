        Hey, I&apos;m a Solutions Architect and one of the founding members of{" "}

          AntStack

        , where I lead the Frontend team. I&apos;ve spent the last 7+ years
        deep in the JavaScript ecosystem, building web apps and obsessing over
        the details that make the difference between something that works and
        something that feels right.

        My day-to-day lives at the intersection of Frontend and AI. I care
        about User Experience and Accessibility more than most people think is
        reasonable — the web should be fast, intuitive, and built for everyone.
        Lately, I&apos;ve been spending a lot of time exploring what AI can do
        when you pair it with good product thinking, and I have a feeling
        I&apos;m just getting started.

        When I&apos;m not staring at a screen full of code, I&apos;m probably
        staring at a screen full of games — PS5 is non-negotiable. I also run a
        3D printer that I use to experiment with ideas that have no business
        plan and no deadline, which is exactly the point. I&apos;m a big EDM
        fan — Skrillex in particular — and I believe a good drop can fix most
        problems. Japanese food is my weakness, Formula 1 is my religion, and
        Bangalore is home.
